## Release Workflow

### Overview

Releases follow these general steps:

1. **Prepare**: Review changes, update documentation, and test
2. **Document**: Write comprehensive release notes in the repository
3. **Commit**: Commit the release notes and any final version/documentation updates
4. **Tag**: Create a git tag for that exact release commit
5. **Publish**: Create a GitHub release from the committed release notes file
6. **Announce**: Notify users and update installation instructions

The key rule is to avoid writing or revising release notes after the release tag has
already been created. The release notes file should be part of the tagged commit so
that the repository state, the tag, and the published GitHub release all refer to the
same snapshot.

## Version Numbering

This project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (SemVer):

```
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
```

- **MAJOR**: Incompatible API changes or breaking changes
- **MINOR**: New features, backwards-compatible
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes, backwards-compatible

### Examples

- `1.0.0` → `2.0.0`: Breaking change (e.g., removed support for Python 3.10)
- `1.0.0` → `1.1.0`: New feature (e.g., added topic modeling pipeline)
- `1.0.0` → `1.0.1`: Bug fix (e.g., fixed S3 synchronization issue)

### Pre-release Versions

Pre-release versions can be tagged with additional labels:

- `1.1.0-alpha.1`: Early testing version
- `1.1.0-beta.1`: Feature-complete, testing phase
- `1.1.0-rc.1`: Release candidate, final testing

## Preparing a Release

### 1. Review Changes

```bash
# Compare with the last release tag
git log v1.0.0..HEAD --oneline

# Review file changes
git diff v1.0.0..HEAD --stat

# Check what's changed in specific areas
git log v1.0.0..HEAD --oneline -- lib/
git log v1.0.0..HEAD --oneline -- "*.mk"
```

### 2. Update Documentation

- [ ] Update `CHANGELOG.md` with all changes since the last release
- [ ] Update `README.md` if there are new features or changes to usage
- [ ] Review and update any outdated documentation
- [ ] Ensure all new features have documentation

### 3. Update Version References

Check and update version references in:

- [ ] `README.md` (installation instructions)
- [ ] `lib/pyproject.toml` (Python package version)
- [ ] Any hardcoded version strings in scripts

### 4. Test the Release

Run comprehensive tests:

```bash
# Test setup
make setup

# Test key pipelines
make test-aws
make check-spacy-pipelines
make check-python-installation

# Test a small newspaper if possible
make newspaper NEWSPAPER=test_newspaper LOGGING_LEVEL=DEBUG
```

## Creating Release Notes

Release notes should be prepared before the tag is created and committed together with
the final release-ready changes. The GitHub release description should then be created
from that committed file instead of being written separately in the web interface.

### Structure

Release notes should include:

1. **Overview**: Brief summary of the release
2. **Major Features**: Significant new functionality
3. **Technical Improvements**: Behind-the-scenes improvements
4. **Bug Fixes**: Issues resolved
5. **Breaking Changes**: Anything that breaks compatibility
6. **Migration Guide**: How to upgrade from previous version
7. **Known Issues**: Any known problems or limitations
8. **Dependencies**: New or updated dependencies
9. **Contributors**: People who contributed to this release

### Template

Use this template structure (see `RELEASE_NOTES_v1.1.0.md` as an example):

```markdown
# Release Notes - v1.X.0

**Release Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Tag:** v1.X.0
**Status:** Stable / Pre-release

### Generating Change Lists

Use git to generate lists of changes:

```bash
# List all commits
git log v1.0.0..HEAD --oneline

# Group by component
git log v1.0.0..HEAD --oneline -- lib/
git log v1.0.0..HEAD --oneline -- "*_lingproc.mk"

# Get commit authors
git shortlog v1.0.0..HEAD -sn

# Get file statistics
git diff v1.0.0..HEAD --stat

# List new files
git diff v1.0.0..HEAD --name-status | grep "^A"

# List modified files
git diff v1.0.0..HEAD --name-status | grep "^M"
```

## Publishing a Release

### 1. Commit Release Notes and Final Metadata

Before tagging, ensure the release notes file and any final documentation or version
updates are committed:

```bash
git add CHANGELOG.md README.md RELEASE_NOTES_v1.1.0.md
git commit -m "Prepare release v1.1.0"
```

This ensures the release notes are part of the exact commit that will be tagged.

### 2. Create Git Tag

```bash
# Create an annotated tag
git tag -a v1.1.0 -m "Release v1.1.0: Description"

# Push the tag
git push origin v1.1.0
```

### 3. Create GitHub Release

#### Via GitHub Web Interface

1. Go to https://github.com/impresso/impresso-make-cookbook/releases
2. Click "Draft a new release"
3. Select the tag you just created
4. Fill in the release title: `v1.1.0` or descriptive name
5. Paste the content of the committed `RELEASE_NOTES_v1.1.0.md` file into the description
6. Check "Set as a pre-release" if applicable
7. Click "Publish release"

#### Via GitHub CLI

```bash
# Install gh CLI if needed
# brew install gh  # macOS
# apt install gh   # Ubuntu

# Authenticate
gh auth login

# Create release from release notes file
gh release create v1.1.0 \
  --title "v1.1.0: Major expansion with new pipelines" \
  --notes-file RELEASE_NOTES_v1.1.0.md \
  --prerelease  # omit for stable release
```

Using `--notes-file` is preferred because it makes the GitHub release text come from
the same file that is stored in git and included in the tagged release commit.

### 4. Update Existing Release (if needed)

If you need to improve release notes for an existing release:

```bash
# Update release notes
gh release edit v1.1.0 \
  --notes-file RELEASE_NOTES_v1.1.0.md

# Or via web interface:
# Go to the release page and click "Edit release"
```

This should be treated as a correction path, not the normal workflow. The normal path
is to finalize and commit the release notes before creating the tag.

## Post-Release Tasks

### 1. Update Main Branch

Ensure `CHANGELOG.md` and any documentation updates are on the main branch:

```bash
git checkout main
git merge --no-ff release-branch
git push origin main
```

### 2. Update Installation Instructions

Verify that installation instructions work:

```bash
# Test pip installation
python3 -m pip install "git+https://github.com/impresso/impresso-make-cookbook.git@v1.1.0#subdirectory=lib"

# Test in Pipfile
# impresso-cookbook = {git = "https://github.com/impresso/impresso-make-cookbook.git", ref = "v1.1.0", subdirectory = "lib"}
```

### 3. Announce Release

- [ ] Update project documentation website (if applicable)
- [ ] Notify team members
- [ ] Post in relevant communication channels
- [ ] Update any deployment automation

### 4. Monitor for Issues

After release:

- Monitor GitHub issues for bug reports
- Check discussion forums or communication channels
- Be prepared to create patch releases if critical bugs are found

## Hotfix Releases

For critical bug fixes:

1. Create a hotfix branch from the release tag:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b hotfix/1.1.1 v1.1.0
   ```

2. Make the fix and test thoroughly

3. Create a patch release:

   ```bash
   git tag -a v1.1.1 -m "Hotfix: Description of critical fix"
   git push origin v1.1.1
   ```

4. Create release with focused release notes on the fix

5. Merge hotfix back to main:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge --no-ff hotfix/1.1.1
   git push origin main
   ```
